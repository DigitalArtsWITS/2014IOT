Course Outcomes:
================

This 2nd semester practice course is a follow on course from Applied Concepts in Interactive Media in the 1st Semester. Students will expand on the skills learnt in the first semester. The learning focus in the first term of the course will be on development in networked media as an expanded practice with Interaction Design. The second term students will work on two research and development projects, the first will be an Internet of Things device implemented in a real world scenario, the second will be collaborative project with Engineering and Electronic Music, this will also act as the final exam project.

Students will gain proficency in the following: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Processing.js, Node.JS, JSON, expanded RaspberryPi, Node-Red, networked and social media intergration.

Annual Collaborative Project with Engineering and Electronic Music Composition.

In this exam project you will work collaboratively with two outside parties.
This is a professional practice exam – marking will focus on these broad areas:

* Your ability to work within a distinct timeline. 
* Your ability to meet procedural deadlines.
* Your ability to work collaboratively with other parties.
* Your ability to document the project process 
* The quality of the finished project.

Specific details will be given to you closer to the time.



Course Rules:
=============

**1. Submissions Rules**  
a. All assignments and projects are to be submitted on the given due date.  
b. Students are expect to manage their time effectively in order to complete projects prior to the given due date.  
c. If assignments & projects are not submitted on the given due date, 5% will be subtracted for every day the project or assignment is late. Please note this includes weekends!  
d. An extension on an assignment or project will only be granted in consultation with the lecturer.  
e. Extensions will only be granted if the request is made before and not on due date (and this does not mean the night or afternoon before).  

**2. Marking & Assessment Rules**  
a. Students are expected to meet and exceed assessment criteria for all assignments, projects and exams.  
b. All assignments and projects are to extend fundamentals covered in classes and workshops; and required to be original.  
c. Plagiarism of code, examples, or text will not be tolerated.  
d. If a student refers to or uses code or text developed by someone else, the student must clearly reference the source.  
e. In the case of plagiarism the project will NOT receive a mark and will therefore count as zero.  
f. If there is a repeat plagiarism offence the student in question risks expulsion from the university.  

**3. Attendance Rules**  
a. Students are expected to attend all Lab Sessions.  
b. If a student is ill, the student is required to contact the lecturer; the student is required to bring a doctors letter on returning.  
c. If the student needs to miss class for any reason other than illness, the student must consult with the lecturer before. The reason for missing and the number of classes the student intends to miss must be discussed with the lecturer before permission can be given.  
d. In both events students are expected to follow up with the lecturer in order to get missed information and complete missed assignments. Extra time for these will be decided in consultation with the lecturer.  

**4. Lab Session & Workshop Participation Rules**  
a. We move extremely fast in the course – you are required to review content before arriving at a Lab Session.  
b. Students are expected to be in class 5 min before the official start time.  
c. The lecturer will not wait for a late student.  
d. Lateness will not be tolerated and will cause the student to forfiet their particpant mark.  
e. The lecturer is not expected to brief student on missed content during a lab session.  
f. Students are expected to take notes in lectures.  
g. If a student does not actively participate during lab sessions and workshop, the student will forfeit their participation mark.  
 
**5. The “Explain It To Me Like I’m 5” Rule**  
The content that we cover can be really complex and we move extremely fast. It will be less complex if you review all the topics before lab sessions, but if you are really sinking and not keeping up you are allowed to call this rule so that the lab session can pause and the content can be dealt with more carefully.
