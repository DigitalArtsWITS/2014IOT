### Part 2.1.1 - Getting started with Node.js
**Led by: Rouan van der Ende**  

This is from the Windows perspective, as it will probably have the most benefit to document this for Windows users. I'll also try to detail as much as possible so beginners can follow along. I'm sorry this will make the writeup a lot longer.

### Install node.js software.

First you'll need to install http://nodejs.org/ it's pretty straight forward.

### Getting used to node

Make yourself a folder on your desktop. I'll call mine **dbapp**. Because we'll get to make it save and retrieve data from a database later on.

Open a command window in this folder. You can either **hold shift and right click on dbapp folder** select **Open command window here**. 
The other way to do this is to go to the windows **start** button bottom left, type in **cmd** and hit enter. This should start a prompt in something like **C:\Users\yourusername>** now if you type in **dir** and enter you'll get a listing of all the files and folders. You should see **Desktop** in that list. To change directory into that type **cd Desktop**. And again **cd dbapp** to get into your folder on the desktop.

Lets test if node is working. Type in and enter:

`node -v`

You should get some version number back, then its all good to go. If not, double check that you installed node.js correctly. You might have to close and reopen the command window if you opened it before installing node.



### It worked

Okay, node allows you to run in interactive REPL mode by just typing and enter:

`node`

You'll get different looking prompt now, like **>_**

You can type and run any javascript command in here. Its also a useful calculator. Try typing a few commands:

```prettyprint
var a = 10
var b = 3
a*b
((3*4) / Math.sqrt(9)) * (5*5)
a*Math.PI
new Date().getMinutes()
os.uptime()
```

This is useful to quickly try some things while you are programming. Play around a bit to get the hang of it. You'll see that `;` are optional with nodejs.

press **Ctrl+C** to quit back to the command prompt.

### Your first node.js program

Now instead of typing in commands one after the other you can type them into a text file, and just run that through node.

In windows, double click on your dbapp folder on your desktop. Now right click in there and go **New > Text Document**

It will make a file called `New Text Document.txt` you might not see the .txt extension. You can enable the display of extensions by going top left menu **Organize > Folder and search options** go to the View tab and then under advanced settings **untick** the **Hide extensions for known file types** option.

Now you can rename the file to whatever you want. Lets change it from `New Text Document.txt` to `hello.js`

Right click on hello.js and open it in notepad. Alternatively in the command promt you can type in:

`notepad hello.js`

Now you can start programming. Notepad is not the best editor to do this, but atleast I know its something you have on your computer. I recommend you try [sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/). 

```prettyprint
var a = 2
var b = 5
var c = 999

while (b <= c) {
	b = b + a
	console.log("hello " + b)	
}
```

Save the file, then run it in the command prompt by typing and pressing enter:

`node hello.js`

I hope that's got you excited. Now try to modify the program and rerunning it.
