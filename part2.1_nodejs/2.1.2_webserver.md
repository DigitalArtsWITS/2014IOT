### Part 2.1.2 - Hello world webserver
**Led by: Rouan van der Ende**  

Well, is anything ever really built from scratch? This week we use [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to build ourselves a simple but powerful webserver. If you haven't used node before you probably want to first go through [getting started with node.js](http://fluentart.com/getting-started-with-node/).

So lets start with the example on the node.js website. This simple web server written in Node responds with "Hello World" for every request. 

```prettyprint
var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
	res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
	res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(1337, '127.0.0.1');
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/');
```

So, copy paste this into a text file, for this example lets use `server.js`. Just as in the [previous tutorial](https://github.com/DigitalArtsWITS/2014IOT/blob/master/part2.1_nodejs/2.1.1_gettingStarted.md), run this script by entering `node server.js` into a command prompt window. Now open [http://127.0.0.1:1337/](http://127.0.0.1:1337/) in your browser. You should see a bland website with just the words Hello World. 
The address 127.0.0.1 is a loop around IP adress computers use to access themselves. It is also possible to use your pc name, or public domain if you have one set up or localhost if you like. 

Okay lets see whats going on here.

```prettyprint
var http = require('http');
```

Variables in node can store just about anything. Here we use the built in function `require()` to load the `http` module into a variable we call http. This provides us with useful functionality to build webservers. You can get more information on this module, as well as everything else available to you by looking at the [api documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/). 

Next you'll probably notice that something looks strange. We are passing a whole function block as a parameter to `http.createServer()`. This is a **callback** function. . 

Lets look at this callback function. It has two parameters **req**uest and **res**ponse.

`req` has all the information about the request, meaning the info about what the client browser is asking the webserver. Some useful properties are **req.url** so you can respond with different pages and **req.method** to differentiate normal page requests and uploads from forms. You can even [get the client's ip address](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8107856/how-can-i-get-the-users-ip-address-using-node-js).

`res` is what we use to respond, essentially send things back to the client's browser.

Okay so lets look at the callback block. This gets executed every time a page is loaded.

First the server replies with [`res.writeHead()`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_writehead_statuscode_reasonphrase_headers). The 200 is a http response code, basicly saying everything is fine. 404 would be that the page could not be found for instance. The [`Content-Type`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type#List_of_common_media_types) is to let the browser know what kind of data to expect next, this could be any type a browser understands like text, html, images, video. 

Next theres a [`res.end()`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_end_data_encoding) sends some data through, in our case **Hello World** and ends the connection after that. We could have also written this as:

```prettyprint
res.write('Hello ');
res.write('World\n');
res.end();
```

This way we can send the data in parts and end when we are done. The `\n` is like sending through an **enter** or **newline** character.

At the end of this we have a .[`listen()`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_listen_port_hostname_backlog_callback) which just enables the server by telling it where to look for incoming connections. This could have been written on its own line instead of chained like this.

Finally we end off with [`console.log()`](http://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_log_data) that lets us know on the command prompt the server is ready.

### How to count page views

Here is the modified code for a webserver that counts visitors. As you can see we add a variable for the counter, increment it everytime there is a vistor going to the root address. Most browsers will try to ask for a favicon too, and you don't want that to increase the visitor count. That would make it count twice for each visitor!

```prettyprint
var http = require('http')
var counter = 0

function httphandle(req,res) 
{
  console.log("Someone is requesting: " + req.url)
  
  if (req.url == "/") 
  {
  	counter = counter + 1	
  	console.log("We've had " + counter + " visitors.")
  }
  
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'})
  res.write('<h1>Hello!</h1>')
  res.write('you are visitor number:' + counter)
  res.end()
}

var theserver = http.createServer(httphandle)
theserver.listen(1337, '127.0.0.1')
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/')
```
